TO Do

- remove core button block and add ACF
- create acf/media-text block that allows for videos.


Internal notes:

- Block registration with no preview. Skip this for ACF fields. This way we don't need to add Editor CSS
- Remove block button styles

Homepage:

HERO
- Heading - text
- Text - textarea
- Clients - do these link?

SERVICES
- Doesnt seem to be in alphabetical order, so we will allow client to choose individual Services and set headings
- should we make this a custom post type? Categories? I think so.

ERICKSON ADVANTAGE
- Repeater - same as PSC "Why PSC" ** remove from client meeting notes
- assumption that background changes with each slide
- Bottom tabs to be removed on smaller screens


FEATURED CASE STUDIES
- Discuss how each block will be selected, have background images, and what this will look like on mobile. This will be very long on mobile.
