case Stusies - filters, when i create content, should i isolate? 
So for example, even though the services are filters and posts, should the filters be pulled from the posts?
Or is it better to keep all content seperate? But then we do hve redundancy.

Hand off meetingnotes:

Multipurpose page sections scroll in
Do we need two thank you page templates?
- Set max width to 2500?
- case study filters - independant locations as taxonomy? Think this has been removed
- Landing pages, add text fields for industry, service, location
- Contact Page - thank you page, different phone number, and service name, phone is based on service. Maybe add phone to the Service post?
Mike
- How will client know which landing page they are using?

- end of January launch. 
- video and image gallery, use case study archive. Videos add 3hours, gallery add 1 hour



TO Do

- Fleet page fields
- Fleet single post fields
- review all fields, naming, and textareas become wysiwyg
- add option to hide Footer call to action
- contact thank you, show department name and phone number
- contact forms add all services except iIDIQ, this will be manual, as they need conditional


- remove core button block and add ACF
- create acf/media-text block that allows for videos.


Internal notes:

- Block registration with no preview. Skip this for ACF fields. This way we don't need to add Editor CSS
- Remove block button styles

The modal sharing: https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main?origin=v7#/console/18218141/384852757/preview?scrollOffset=1547

OK, some questions. :)

Use case scenario. I am searching Google and I find a link to the Bell 212. And I click the link.

- it takes me to the main Fleet page and opens the modal lightbox for the Bell 212.
- If I close the modal, because of pagination (with load more) you might not be able to see that aircraft till you hit load more. Is that an issue? I don't see any other way using modals. 
- the share functionality will direct the user to the single page, then we redirect tot he modal lightbox just like when someone finds the link in Google. Same behavior as above. 

I just wanted to make sure that you realize this is how it will work.
