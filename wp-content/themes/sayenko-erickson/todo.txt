QA:

- footer cTA phone color
- Services results - dont round up and make format optional


TO DO:

- Pardot integration (which will require help from them), 
- Email template (which I know is going to go over budget. Creating editable regions etc… there’s lots to learn when creating an email template for an app). 
- Adding any content I’m supposed to add. 
- Case Studies independant filters?
- when logged in, show seciton id link?
- Team - add, style proper photos (can't do until we have photos)

------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Issues:

- [FIXED] History: All isnt working, need to submit to FacetWP

- Laravel Mix didn't compile for IE 11. Had to add: https://github.com/JeffreyWay/laravel-mix/issues/2174#issuecomment-569929210



Next time, provide flat icons set that contains only relavant icons, so we can use as font icons

- Case Studies independant filters
- when logged in, show seciton id link?

------------------------------------------------------------------ 

WP All Import

- change old site to no SSL - causes issues with importing images

Internal notes:

- Block registration with no preview. Skip this for ACF fields. This way we don't need to add Editor CSS
- Remove block button styles
